# Mobile Price Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest
# Objective:

Our objective is to predict the price range of a mobile phone by building a model that takes into account various features provided in the dataset. We will be using supervised learning methods such as Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forest to determine the best model for this problem.
